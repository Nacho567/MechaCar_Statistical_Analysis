# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## **Overview**

This week we were tasked with analyzing AutosRUs' newest prototype, the MechaCar. We looked at the linear regression of several variables in regards to predicting the MPG, we collected summary statistics on the PSI from each manufacturing lot, ran t-tests to see if the manufacturing lots were statistically different, and then designed a study to compare the MechaCar to other manufacturers.

## **Results**

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
